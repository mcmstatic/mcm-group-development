A first service collects the value of the signals relating to the normal operating actions of the main machine groups, such as the tool change, the pallet change, the block and outlet of the table while another service provides for the execution of test programs in the machine at intervals of preset time (fingerprint), recording the power absorbed when empty. Algorithms for comparing the data of the current operation with respect to the episodes acquired over time, provide indicators to <strong>highlight any anomalies of a component or of a machine group<\/strong>.  <\/p>\n<p>Another service under development is that relating to the <strong>monitoring of the manufacturing process<\/strong>. Also in this case, the collection of data concerning the use of tools in various contexts, represents a very interesting knowledge base for the user and will also serve for the development of even more advanced services for the <strong>optimization of tool management<\/strong>. <\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/section>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To complete the FMS plant management solution, MCM recently developed a new machine data monitoring and predictive maintenance system, composed of different sensors and the Edge jNODE FR device on which MCE, the group\u2019s IT division, has implemented the jFRX software. for high frequency collection and aggregation of machine data.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3042,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"footnotes":""},"categories":[20],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3433"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3433"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3433\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3647,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3433\/revisions\/3647"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3042"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3433"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3433"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/group-mcm.it\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3433"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
